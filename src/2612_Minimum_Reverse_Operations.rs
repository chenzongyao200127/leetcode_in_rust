// 2612_Minimum_Reverse_Operations
// https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-reverse-operations/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-03-20

// You are given an integer n and an integer p representing an array arr of length n where all elements are set to 0's, except position p which is set to 1. You are also given an integer array banned containing restricted positions. Perform the following operation on arr:

// Reverse a subarray with size k if the single 1 is not set to a position in banned.

// Return an integer array answer with n results where the ith result is the minimum number of operations needed to bring the single 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible.

impl Solution {
    pub fn min_reverse_operations(n: i32, p: i32, banned: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> Vec<i32> {}
}
